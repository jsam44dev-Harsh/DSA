Steps to remember while solving Patterns Questions.

Patterns are not generally asked in interview but they help understand loops.

To master loops, one should practice Pattern Questions.

Step1: for the outer loop, count the no of lines.
Step2: for the inner loop, focus on the columns, and connect them somehow to the rows.
Step3: print '*' inside the inner loop.
Step4: Observe Symmetry [Optional].
